Problem Statement:

- We are relying on hand reciepts and paper notices in order to track equipment and help-desk tickets. Our current solution is segmented and requires access to multiple databases in order to properly track tasks.

Solution:

- Our proposed solution is to create an all encompassing application that will be a one-stop-shop for all things IT, help-desk, and ticketing issues.

Why:

- This solution fixes the issues of having to keep track of paper tasks, account/database accesses, and should solve many of the human-error issues that we come across regularly. Our solution also allows easy cross-referencing of equipment and tickets.
